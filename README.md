# Minecart Collisions (Spigot)

### Have you ever wanted to beat the everloving hell out of someone?

### Do you watch those roblox car crash compilations that are for some reason on your home page?

### Well now you can!

Introducing the minecart collisions plugin! Perfect for your nefarious deeds that will be soon to come! Run over all your players with only 5 iron ingots and your sheer will to get the many materials needed for your powered rails! Launch your friends into the air holding a feather in your hand while you're in the minecart and get an insane speed boost (Fall damage is included)! Blow yourself up to smithereens holding tnt! Instantly KILL anyone in your path holding an anvil! Or just go the cheaper route with a pufferfish bucket that does 2x the damage but it's cool too I guess.
